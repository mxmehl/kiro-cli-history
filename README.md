A terminal UI for fuzzy-searching, browsing, and resuming [Kiro CLI](https://kiro.dev/docs/cli/) conversations.

## The problem

Kiro CLI has great built-in [conversation persistence](https://kiro.dev/docs/cli/chat/#conversation-persistence) — it saves your sessions and lets you resume them with `--resume` and `--resume-picker`. However, these are scoped to the directory where the session was started. If you work across many projects and directories, finding a specific past conversation means remembering which folder you were in at the time.

`kiro-cli-history` complements Kiro CLI's native persistence by adding **global fuzzy search across all sessions** — regardless of which directory they were started in. It searches the full content of every message exchanged, not just session titles.

## What it offers

- **Global search** — find conversations across all directories, not just the current one
- **Full-text fuzzy search** — searches every message you and Kiro exchanged, not just titles
- **Conversation preview** — read through the full exchange with markdown rendering before deciding to resume
- **One-key resume** — press `Ctrl+R` to jump into Kiro CLI and continue the conversation
- **Copy to clipboard** — press `Ctrl+Y` to copy an entire conversation
- **All session formats** — reads all three Kiro CLI storage versions (v1 SQLite, v2 SQLite, v3 JSONL), covering both `--classic` and new TUI modes

## Read-only

This tool **never writes to or modifies** your Kiro CLI session data. It only reads from:
- `~/.kiro/sessions/cli/` (JSONL sessions)
- `~/Library/Application Support/kiro-cli/data.sqlite3` (SQLite sessions, opened in read-only mode)

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/prabhugr/kiro-cli-history.git
cd kiro-cli-history
bash install.sh
```

### Dependencies

- Python 3.9+
- [textual](https://github.com/Textualize/textual) (installed automatically by `install.sh`)

## Usage

```bash
kiro-cli-history
```

Run it from anywhere. It searches globally.

### Keyboard shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `/` | Focus search bar |
| `j` / `k` or arrows | Navigate sessions |
| `Ctrl+R` | Resume the highlighted session in Kiro CLI |
| `Ctrl+Y` | Copy conversation to clipboard |
| `Ctrl+F` | Focus search bar |
| `Esc` | Clear search / Quit |
| `Ctrl+C` | Quit |

### Searching

Type in the search bar to fuzzy-search across:
- Session titles
- Working directories
- Full conversation content (every message exchanged)

Search is case-insensitive and covers all session formats.

### Text selection

Hold **Option (Alt)** while dragging to select text from the preview pane. Or press **Ctrl+Y** to copy the full conversation to clipboard.

## How it works

Kiro CLI stores conversations in three formats depending on the version and mode:

| Format | Location | Used by |
|--------|----------|---------|
| v3 (JSONL) | `~/.kiro/sessions/cli/*.json` + `*.jsonl` | `kiro-cli --classic` |
| v2 (SQLite) | `~/Library/Application Support/kiro-cli/data.sqlite3` | New TUI mode (`kiro-cli`) |
| v1 (SQLite) | Same database, `conversations` table | Legacy |

`kiro-cli-history` reads all three and presents them in a unified view. Each session shows:
- **Title** — first message or auto-generated title
- **Directory** — where the session was started
- **Date** — last activity (e.g., "7 Apr 2026")
- **Message count** — total exchanges
- **Duration** — elapsed time

## How this complements Kiro CLI

Kiro CLI's native `--resume` and `--resume-picker` work well when you know which directory a session was started in. `kiro-cli-history` is a companion tool for when you need to find a conversation but don't remember where it happened — it gives you a global view with full-text search.

| | `--resume-picker` (native) | `kiro-cli-history` |
|---|---|---|
| Scope | Current directory | All directories |
| Search | Browse by title | Full-text across all messages |
| Preview | Title + message count | Full conversation with markdown |

## Platform

macOS (uses `pbcopy` for clipboard, macOS-specific paths).

Community PRs for Linux/Windows support are welcome.

## Uninstall

```bash
bash uninstall.sh
```
